# leaflet-challenge
Javascript and html map of earthquakes and tectonic plates.  The earthquake data is the last recorded earthquakes in the past week.  The opacity of the markers is representative of the earthquakeâ€™s depth and the radius of the marker is representative of the magnitude of the earthquake.  The data was obtained from a geoJSON from the USGS.  The tectonic plate data was obtained from a github (https://github.com/fraxen/tectonicplates).  The color of the marker is representative of the depth of the earthquake and a legend is provided.  A heat map element was added to see the extent of clusters of earthquakes.
